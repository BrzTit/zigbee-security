#summary Implementation of Reflexive and Selective Jamming Techniques
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

The Reflexive Jamming code is written for the Tmote Sky / TelosB platform, and is available in GoodFET and KillerBee on the those devices. 

The Selective Jamming code is written for USRP2 devices currently, although we are programming it to be on microcontrollers.

= Reflexive Jamming =

Currently our reflexive jamming (aka collision) implementation (on a Tmote/TelosB device) can jam a frame on the 8th byte (aka works for any frames this long, which are all frames except ACK), and will _cause the FCS to be invalid and thus a receiving radio will drop the frame_ if it has AUTOCRC (or similar) enabled, which should be all commercial devices (aka anything except sniffers). For more questions, please contact us.

_TODO Discuss in depth._

= Selective Jamming =

If you'd like the USRP2 code, including a proof-of-concept on association response frames like we demoed at ShmooCon, email us. We'll hopefully get a chance to do it on a uC platform soon.
