= Introduction =

This is intended as a brief guide. Full documentation should be obtained from the datasheet, user guide, common sense, the source code, or asking for assistance.

= Compile and Flash GoodFET Firmware =

 # Update/checkout to GoodFET SVN trunk (`svn co https://goodfet.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/goodfet goodfet`)
 # Set parameters, make, and flash the GoodFET code:
{{{
$ cd goodfet/trunk/firmware
$ export board=apimote1
$ make clean install
$ ../client/goodfet.bsl --speed=38400 --swap-reset-test -e -p goodfet.hex
}}}

= Reported Trouble =

This is a first hardware revision board. If you have an error not seen here, please file a ticket or contact us.

   * Under Linux, the FTDI chip may be recognized (`lsusb`) but does not show up as a serial device. This is likely due to the Apimote utilizing a modern FTDI chip, requiring a newer Linux kernel. Ubuntu 11.10 and later for example come with already installed drivers that support the new FTDI. Otherwise, install the latest drivers from FTDI.
  * The Linux FTDI drivers are a bit flaky. OS X FTDI drivers have no issues. We will be working with Travis to roll out a linux patch, using the Facedancer. We suspect is has something to do with the new drivers failing to call a reset
